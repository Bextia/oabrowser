# threejs-atlas-viewer
This repository hosts the files for an atlas viewer application.

This is not a standalone application. You need to provide an atlas structure JSON file in the config.js file.

To use the viewer :
* go in atlas repository
* add this repository as submodule
* run `bower install` in it
* provide the path to the JSON structure file in `config.js`
* run a server at the root of your initial repository
* now you can open your browser and enjoy the viewer
